description: Call from your CI

<Intro>
  This project provides a [`build.yml` reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#calling-a-reusable-workflow) you can easily call from your own project workflow.
</Intro>

In your `.github/workflows` folder, create a eg. `docs.yml` file:

```yml
uses: pmndrs/docs/.github/workflows/build.yml@v2
  with:
    mdx: 'docs'
    libname: 'React Three Fiber'
    libname_short: 'r3f'
    libname_dotsuffix_label: "docs"
    libname_dotsuffix_href: "https://docs.pmnd.rs"
    home_redirect: '/getting-started/introduction'
    icon: '🇨🇭'
    logo: '/logo.png'
    github: 'https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber'
    discord: 'https://discord.com/channels/740090768164651008/740093168770613279'
    theme_primary: '#323e48'
    theme_scheme: 'tonalSpot'
    theme_contrast: '0'
    theme_note: '#1f6feb'
    theme_tip: '#238636'
    theme_important: '#8957e5'
    theme_warning: '#d29922'
    theme_caution: '#da3633'
```
