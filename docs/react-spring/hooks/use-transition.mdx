## Overview

```js
import { useTransition, animated } from 'react-spring'
```

An animated TransitionGroup. Feed it your items and lifecycles. Whenever items are added or removed, it will animate these changes.

### You can transition arrays

<Demo name="chain-use-transition" />

### Toggle between components

<Demo name="components-use-transition" />

### Mount/Unmount single-component reveals

<Demo name="mount-use-transition" />

The `transition` function accepts a callback that receives four arguments: the animated values,
the item, the `Transition` object, and the sibling position.

It returns a React fragment containing every element returned by your
callback. As you might assume, elements in the middle of their `leave`
animation need to remain mounted.

All elements in the fragment are guaranteed to have a `key` prop, whether or
not you define one explicitly. Unkeyed elements will use the `ctrl.id` from
their `Transition` object.

For every unique item key, there exists a `Transition` object. The only time
you have access to a `Transition` object is when it's passed as the 3rd argument
of your transition callback.

```js
// The `t` argument is a Transition object.
// The `i` argument is the sibling position.
const elems = transition((style, item, t, i) => <a.div style={style}>{t.phase}</a.div>)
```

### Keys

Every `Transition` object has a unique key that identifies it. You have the
option of defining explicit keys or letting the "item" (the value represented
by the `Transition` object) be its own key.

To define explicit keys, you must define the `keys` prop in your `useTransition`
props. For example, when using an items array, the new `keys` prop can be:

- an array of keys
- or a mapping function that returns a key for any item given to it.

```js
useTransition(items, {
  // Using a function
  keys: (item) => item.key,
  // Using an array created by lodash.map
  keys: _.map(items, 'key'),
})
```

⚠️ You **must** use explicit keys for any item that is an immutable object.

Using explicit keys for mutable objects is unnecessary. 🥳

If you're passing a single item to `useTransition`, you have the option of
passing a single key as the `key` prop.

```js
useTransition(item, {
  key: item.key,
})
```

### Expires

The `expires` prop lets you control when removed items are unmounted (after
their `leave` animation has finished). By default, unmounting is postponed
until the next render or until all transitions are resting.

When `true` or `<= 0`, the default behavior is used.

When `false`, items are never unmounted.

When `> 0`, this prop is used in a `setTimeout` call that forces a
rerender if the component that called `useTransition` doesn't rerender
on its own after an item's `leave` animation is finished.

Finally, the `expires` prop can be a function that receives an item and returns any of
the values mentioned above.

### Sort

The `sort` prop is a function that takes two items, returns `-1` when
the 1st item should appear first, and returns `1` when the 2nd item should.

It's a useful shortcut for slicing and sorting your items array before passing
it to the `useTransition` hook.

```js
// v8
useTransition(items.slice().sort(props.sort), null, props)

// v9
useTransition(items, {
  sort: (a, b) => { ... },
  ...props
})
```

## Additional notes

### Multi-stage transitions

The initial/from/enter/update/leave lifecycles can be objects, arrays or functions. When you provide a function you have access to individual items. The function is allowed to return plain objects, or either an array or a function for multi-stage transitions. When you provide a plain array you also can form a basic multi-stage transition (without access to the item).

```jsx
useTransition(items, {
  enter: (item) => [{ opacity: item.opacity, height: item.height }, { life: '100%' }],
  leave: (item) => async (next, cancel) => {
    await next({ life: '0%' })
    await next({ opacity: 0 })
    await next({ height: 0 })
  },
  from: { life: '0%', opacity: 0, height: 0 },
})
```

### Transitioning between routes

```jsx
const location = useLocation()
const transitions = useTransition(location, { ... })
return transitions((props, item) => (
  <animated.div style={props}>
    <Switch location={item}>
      <Route path="/a" component={A} />
      <Route path="/b" component={B} />
      <Route path="/c" component={C} />
    </Switch>
  </animated.div>
))
```
