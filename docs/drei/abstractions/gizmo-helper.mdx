Used by widgets that visualize and control camera position.

Two example gizmos are included: GizmoViewport and GizmoViewcube, and `useGizmoContext` makes it easy to create your own.

```jsx
<GizmoHelper
  alignment="bottom-right" // widget alignment within scene
  margin={[80, 80]} // widget margins (X, Y)
  onUpdate={/* called during camera animation  */}
  onTarget={/* return current camera target (e.g. from orbit controls) to center animation */}
>
  <GizmoViewport axisColors={['red', 'green', 'blue']} labelColor="black" />
  {/* alternative: <GizmoViewcube /> */}
</GizmoHelper>
```
