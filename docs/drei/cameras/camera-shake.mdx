A component for applying a configurable camera shake effect. Currently only supports rotational camera shake. Pass a ref to recieve the `ShakeController` API.

```jsx
const config = {
  maxYaw: 0.1, // Max amount camera can yaw in either direction
  maxPitch: 0.1, // Max amount camera can pitch in either direction
  maxRoll: 0.1, // Max amount camera can roll in either direction
  yawFrequency: 1, // Frequency of the the yaw rotation
  pitchFrequency: 1, // Frequency of the pitch rotation
  rollFrequency: 1, // Frequency of the roll rotation
  intensity: 1, // initial intensity of the shake
  decay: false, // should the intensity decay over time
  decayRate: 0.65, // if decay = true this is the rate at which intensity will reduce at
  additive: false, // this should be used when your scene has orbit controls
}

<CameraShake {...config} />


interface ShakeController {
  getIntensity: () => number
  setIntensity: (val: number) => void
}
```
