A [`THREE.CubeCamera`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera) that returns its texture as a render-prop. It makes children invisible while rendering to the internal buffer so that they are not included in the reflection.

Using the `frames` prop you can control if this camera renders indefinitively or statically (a given number of times).
If you have two static objects in the scene, make it `frames={2}` for instance, so that both objects get to "see" one another in the reflections, which takes multiple renders.
If you have moving objects, unset the prop and use a smaller `resolution` instead.

```jsx
import { CubeCamera } from '@react-three/drei'
;<CubeCamera
  resolution={256} // Size of the off-buffer (256 by default)
  frames={Infinity} // How many frames it should render (Indefinitively by default)
  fog={customFog} // Allows you to pass a Fog or FogExp2 instance for a smaller frustrum
  near={1}
  far={1000}
>
  {(texture) => (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial envMap={texture} />
    </mesh>
  )}
</CubeCamera>
```
