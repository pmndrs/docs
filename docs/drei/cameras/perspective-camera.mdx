A responsive [THREE.PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) that can set itself as the default.

```jsx
import { PerspectiveCamera } from '@react-three/drei'

<PerspectiveCamera
  makeDefault // Registers it as the default camera system-wide (default=false)
  {...props} // All THREE.PerspectiveCamera props are valid
/>
<mesh />
```

You can also give it children, which will now occupy the same position as the camera and follow along as it moves.

```jsx
import { PerspectiveCamera } from '@react-three/drei'
;<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault {...props}>
  <mesh />
</PerspectiveCamera>
```

You can also drive it manually, it won't be responsive and you have to calculate aspect ration yourself.

```jsx
import { PerspectiveCamera } from '@react-three/drei'

<PerspectiveCamera manual aspect={...} onUpdate={(c) => c.updateProjectionMatrix()}>
```
