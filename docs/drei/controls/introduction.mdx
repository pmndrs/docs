If available controls have damping enabled by default, they manage their own updates, remove themselves on unmount, are compatible with the `invalidateFrameloop` canvas-flag. They inherit all props from their underlying [THREE controls](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/tree/dev/examples/jsm/controls).

Every control component can be used with a custom camera using the `camera` prop:

```jsx
const myCamera = useResource()

return (
  <>
    <PerspectiveCamera ref={myCamera} position={[0, 5, 5]} />
    <OrbitControls camera={myCamera.current} />
  </>
)
```

PointerLockControls additionally supports a `selector` prop, which enables the binding of `click` event handlers for control activation to other elements than `document` (e.g. a 'Click here to play' button).
