title: TrackballControls

`TrackballControls` is similar to `OrbitControls`. However, it does not maintain a constant camera up vector. That means if the camera orbits over the “north” and “south” poles, it does not flip to stay "right side up".

```jsx
import { TrackballControls } from '@react-three/drei'

;<TrackballControls />
```
