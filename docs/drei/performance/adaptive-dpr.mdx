Drop this component into your scene and it will cut the pixel-ratio on [regress](#) according to the canvases performance min/max settings. This allows you to temporarily reduce visuals for more performance, for instance when the camera moves (look into drei's controls `regress` flag). Optionally you can set the canvas to a pixelated filter, which would be even faster.

```jsx
<AdaptiveDpr pixelated />
```
