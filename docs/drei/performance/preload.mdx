title: Preload
---

The WebGLRenderer will compile materials only when they hit the frustrum, which can cause jank. This component precompiles the scene using [gl.compile](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/renderers/WebGLRenderer.compile) which makes sure that your app is responsive from the get go.

By default gl.compile will only preload visible objects, if you supply the `all` prop, it will circumvent that. With the `scene` and `camera` props you could also use it in portals.

If you have async models you can drop it into the same suspense boundary _in concurrent mode_.

```jsx
<Canvas concurrent>
  <Suspense fallback={null}>
    <Model />
    <Preload all />
```
