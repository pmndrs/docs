title: useAspect
nav: 37

This hook calculates aspect ratios (for now only what in css would be `image-size: cover` is supported). You can use it to make an image fill the screen. It is responsive and adapts to viewport resize. Just give the hook the image bounds in pixels. It returns an array: `[width, height, 1]`.

```jsx
const scale = useAspect(
  1024,                     // Pixel-width
  512,                      // Pixel-height
  1                         // Optional scaling factor
)
return (
  <mesh scale={scale}>
    <planeBufferGeometry />
    <meshBasicMaterial map={imageTexture} />
```
