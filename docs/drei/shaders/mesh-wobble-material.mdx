This material makes your geometry wobble and wave around. It was taken from the [threejs-examples](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_modified) and adapted into a self-contained material.

```jsx
<mesh>
  <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" />
  <MeshWobbleMaterial
    attach="material"
    factor={1} // Strength, 0 disables the effect (default=1)
    speed={10} // Speed (default=1)
  />
</mesh>
```
