## Role Button of the A11y component

This role is meant to emulate the behaviour of a button.
It will display a cursor pointer when your cursor is over the linked 3D object.
It will call a function on click but also on any kind of action that would trigger a focused button (Enter, Double-Tap, ...).
It is also actionnable by user using a screen reader.

```jsx
<A11y
  role="button"
  description="Send email"
  activationMsg="Sending email"
  actionCall={()=>sendEmail()}
  ... >
  <Some3DComponent />
</A11y>
```

Using it like this makes it focusable to all kind of users.

You should also use the useA11y() hook within the encapsulated components to adjust the rendering on hover and focus. Doing so greatly improve the accessibility of your page.
Take a look at this code sample to see how to use it.
You can also play with it in [this demo](https://n4rzi.csb.app)

```jsx
function Some3DComponent() {
  const a11y = useA11y()
  return (
    <mesh>
      <boxBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial
        metalness={1}
        roughness={0.8}
        color={a11y.focus || a11y.hover ? '#cc66dd' : '#ffffff'}
        emissive={a11y.focus ? '#cc4444' : a11y.hover ? '#339922' : '#003399'}
      />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

You could also specify the optional prop `activationMsg`.
The message withinh activationMsg will be announced by screenreader when the button is activated.
