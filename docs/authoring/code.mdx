<Intro>
  Code blocks with syntax highlighting.
</Intro>

Line numbers/highlights are supported:

````md
```tsx {1,4-6} showLineNumbers
type Props = {who: string}

function Hi({who}: Props) {
  return (
    <p>Hello, {who}!</p>
  )
}
```
````

result:

```tsx {1,4-6} showLineNumbers
type Props = {who: string}

function Hi({who}: Props) {
  return (
    <p>Hello, {who}!</p>
  )
}
```

---

You can start at a specific `X` line number `showLineNumbers=X`:

````md
```tsx {1,4-6} showLineNumbers=150
type Props = {who: string}

function Hi({who}: Props) {
  return (
    <p>Hello, {who}!</p>
  )
}
```
````

result:

```tsx {1,4-6} showLineNumbers=150
type Props = {who: string}

function Hi({who}: Props) {
  return (
    <p>Hello, {who}!</p>
  )
}
```

````md
```diff
diff --git a/example.txt b/example.txt
