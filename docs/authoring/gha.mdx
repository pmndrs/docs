<Intro>
  The Gha component (GitHub Alerts) displays styled callout boxes with different severity levels. These alerts use GitHub's native syntax and automatically adapt to light and dark themes, making them perfect for highlighting important information, tips, warnings, and cautions.
</Intro>

Aka. ["GitHub alerts"](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/16925)

```md
<Gha keyword="NOTE">Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.</Gha>
```

or better:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.
```

result:

> [!NOTE]
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

We also support: `[!TIP]`, `[!IMPORTANT]`, `[!WARNING]`, `[!CAUTION]`

result:

> [!TIP]
> Optional information to help a user be more successful.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]

> [!CAUTION]
