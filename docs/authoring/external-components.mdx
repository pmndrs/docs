<Intro>
  External components are optional MDX components that can be enabled or disabled via environment variables. This allows you to keep your documentation lightweight by only including the components you need.
</Intro>

## Configuration

External components are configured via environment variables:

```sh
# Disable Sandpack component
export EXTERNAL_SANDPACK=false

# Build without Sandpack
npm run build
```

## Available External Components

### Sandpack

Interactive code sandboxes powered by CodeSandbox.

**Installation:**

```sh
npm install @codesandbox/sandpack-react
```

**Configuration:**

Sandpack is **enabled by default**. To disable it:

```sh
export EXTERNAL_SANDPACK=false
```

**Usage:**

See the [Sandpack documentation](./sandpack.mdx) for full usage details.

> [!NOTE]
> If Sandpack is enabled but the package is not installed, the system will show a warning and skip rendering Sandpack components.

## Disabling External Components

To disable an external component, set its environment variable to `false`:

```sh
export EXTERNAL_SANDPACK=false
```

When disabled:
- The component will not be available in MDX files
- The dependency is not required
- Your documentation bundle will be smaller

You can also disable components at build time:

```sh
EXTERNAL_SANDPACK=false npm run build
```

## Benefits

External components allow you to:
- **Reduce bundle size** - Only include what you need
- **Faster builds** - Fewer dependencies to process
- **Flexible configuration** - Enable/disable per environment
- **Backward compatibility** - Existing projects continue to work

## Default Configuration

By default, all external components are **enabled** to maintain backward compatibility with existing projects.

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Component | Default | Description |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `EXTERNAL_SANDPACK` | Sandpack | `true` | Set to `false` to disable Sandpack |

## Creating Custom External Components

To add your own external component to this system:

1. Create your component in `src/components/mdx/YourComponent/`
2. Add it to the external components registry in `src/utils/externalComponents.ts`
3. Add a new environment variable (e.g., `EXTERNAL_YOURCOMPONENT`)
4. Update this documentation

> [!TIP]
> This architecture allows the documentation system to remain modular and extensible while keeping the core lightweight.
