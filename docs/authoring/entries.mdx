<Intro>
  Displays all documentation entries in a multi-column layout, grouped by category.
</Intro>

The `Entries` component automatically generates a directory listing of all documentation pages in the site, organized by their top-level category (first segment of the slug).

```md
<Entries />
```

result:

<Entries />

## CodeSandbox integration

When a documentation page includes a CodeSandbox component, the Entries listing will automatically display a CodeSandbox icon next to that page's link. For example, this page includes:

```md
<Codesandbox id="5w35n6" />
```

result:

<Codesandbox id="5w35n6" />

This means this page will appear in the Entries listing with a CodeSandbox icon.

## Excluding categories

You can exclude specific categories from the listing using the `excludedGroups` prop:

```md
<Entries excludedGroups={['getting-started', 'tutorials']} />
```

## How it works

The component:
- Groups all documentation pages by their first slug segment (category)
- Displays categories in alphabetical order with capitalized headings
- Shows each page's title as a clickable link
- Includes CodeSandbox icons next to pages that contain CodeSandbox examples
- Renders in a responsive multi-column layout (2 columns on mobile, 3 on desktop)
