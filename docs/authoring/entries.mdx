<Intro>
  Displays all documentation entries in a multi-column layout, grouped by category.
</Intro>

The `Entries` component automatically generates a directory listing of all documentation pages in the site, organized by their top-level category (first segment of the slug).

```md
<Entries />
```

result:

<Entries />

> [!TIP]
> When a page includes a `<CodeSandbox>` component, the Entries listing will automatically display its thumb next to that page's link.
