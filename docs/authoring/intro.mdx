<Intro>
  The Intro component provides a prominent introduction section at the top of documentation pages, allowing for richer content than the frontmatter description field. It supports markdown formatting, links, lists, and multiple paragraphs.
</Intro>

Use at the top of the document, just after the frontmatter.

```md
<Intro>
  This is an intro. Here you can write a long description of the article, longer than the frontmatter `description`, eventually with [links](#), lists, etc.
  
  Multiple paragraphs are also possible, or anything.
</Intro>
```

result:

<Intro>
  This is an intro. Here you can write a long description of the article, longer than the frontmatter `description`, eventually with [links](#), lists, etc.
  
  Multiple paragraphs are also possible, or anything.
