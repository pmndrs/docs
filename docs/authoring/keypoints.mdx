<Intro>
  The Keypoints component highlights key takeaways or main topics covered in an article. It presents items as a visually distinct bulleted list, typically used after the Intro component to give readers a quick overview of what they'll learn.
</Intro>

Can be used after `Intro`, to list main points the article covers: one bullet per `KeypointsItem`.

```md
<Keypoints title="What you'll learn">
  <KeypointsItem>First item</KeypointsItem>
  <KeypointsItem>Second **item**</KeypointsItem>
</Keypoints>
```

result:

<Keypoints title="What you'll learn">
  <KeypointsItem>First item</KeypointsItem>
  <KeypointsItem>Second **item**</KeypointsItem>
</Keypoints>
