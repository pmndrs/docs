<Intro>
  The Img component and markdown image syntax provide flexible ways to display images in your documentation. Images can be referenced relatively, with automatic dimension handling to prevent layout shift, and support both markdown and HTML syntax for advanced styling.

Relative images are supported. Eg, inside your [`MDX`](introduction#configuration:~:text=MDX) folder:
```text {2}
|-- authoring
|   |-- img.mdx  <= relative to this article
|   `-- gutenberg.jpg
```

```md
---
title: Images

![](gutenberg.jpg)
```

result:

![](gutenberg.jpg)

> [!TIP]
> You are encouraged to use relative images, since dimensions are automatically added as `img[width][height]` attributes.

> For others, think about adding them to **prevent layout shift**.

It is also possible to specify only one dimension (other is inferred from intrinsic ratio), eg:

```md
<img src="gutenberg.jpg" height="200" />
```

result:

<img src="gutenberg.jpg" height="200" />

Although it is probably better to use CSS for this:

```md
<img src="gutenberg.jpg" style={{width: 'auto', height: '10rem'}} />
```

result:

<img src="gutenberg.jpg" style={{width: 'auto', height: '10rem'}} />
