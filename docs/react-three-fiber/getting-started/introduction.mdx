```bash
npm install three @react-three/fiber
```

### Why?

Build your scene declaratively with re-usable, self-contained components that react to state, are readily interactive and can tap into React's ecosystem.

#### Does it have limitations?

None. Everything that works in Threejs will work here without exception.

#### Can it keep up with frequent updates to Threejs?

Yes. There is no hard dependency on a particular Threejs version, it does not wrap or duplicate a single Threejs class. It merely expresses Threejs in JSX: `<mesh />` becomes `new THREE.Mesh()`, and that happens dynamically.

#### Is it slower than plain Threejs?

No. There is no additional overhead. Components participate in a unified renderloop outside of React. It outperforms Threejs in scale due to Reacts scheduling abilities.

### What does it look like?

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Let's make a re-usable component that has its own state, reacts to user-input and participates
      in the render-loop. (

```jsx
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react'
import { Canvas, useFrame } from '@react-three/fiber'

function Box(props) {
  // This reference will give us direct access to the mesh
  const mesh = useRef()
  // Set up state for the hovered and active state
  const [hovered, setHover] = useState(false)
  const [active, setActive] = useState(false)
  // Subscribe this component to the render-loop, rotate the mesh every frame
  useFrame((state, delta) => (mesh.current.rotation.x += 0.01))
  // Return view, these are regular three.js elements expressed in JSX
  return (
    <mesh
      {...props}
      ref={mesh}
      scale={active ? 1.5 : 1}
      onClick={(event) => setActive(!active)}
      onPointerOver={(event) => setHover(true)}
      onPointerOut={(event) => setHover(false)}
    >
      <boxGeometry args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial color={hovered ? 'hotpink' : 'orange'} />
    </mesh>
  )

### Fundamentals

You need to be versed in both React and `three.js` before rushing into this. If you are unsure about React consult the official [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html), especially [the section about hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). As for `three.js`, make sure you at least glance over the following links:

- Make sure you have a [basic grasp of `three.js`](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#manual/en/introduction/Creating-a-scene). Keep that site open.
- When you know what a scene is, a camera, mesh, geometry, material, fork the [demo above](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber#what-does-it-look-like).
- [Look up](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html#api/en/objects/Mesh) the JSX elements that you see (mesh, ...), _all_ threejs exports are native to three-fiber.
- Try changing some values, scroll through our [Api](/markdown/api.md) to see what the various settings and hooks do.
