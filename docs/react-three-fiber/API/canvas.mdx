The `Canvas` object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>
)
```

The props available for the canvas are:

| Prop            | Description                                                        | Default                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| children        | Threejs jsx elements or regular components                         |                                                          |
| gl              | Props that go into the default renderer, or your own renderer      | `{}`                                                     |
| camera          | Props that go into the default camera, or your own THREE.Camera    | `{ fov: 75, near: 0.1, far: 1000, position: [0, 0, 5] }` |
| shadows         | Props that go into gl.shadowMap, can also be set true for PCFsoft  | `false`                                                  |
| raycaster       | Props that go into the default raycaster                           | `{}`                                                     |
| vr              | Switches renderer to VR mode, then uses gl.setAnimationLoop        | `false`                                                  |
| mode            | React mode: legacy, blocking, concurrent                           | `blocking`                                               |
| frameloop       | Render mode: always, demand, never                                 | `always`                                                 |
| resize          | Resize config, see react-use-measure's options                     | `{ scroll: true, debounce: { scroll: 50, resize: 0 } }`  |
| orthographic    | Creates an orthographic camera                                     | `false`                                                  |
| dpr             | Pixel-ratio, use window.devicePixelRatio, or automatic: [min, max] | `undefined`                                              |
| linear          | Switch off automatic sRGB encoding and gamma correction            | `false`                                                  |
| flat            | Use THREE.NoToneMapping instead of THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping     | `false`                                                  |
| onCreated       | Callback after the canvas has rendered (but not yet committed)     | `(state) => {}`                                          |
| onPointerMissed | Response for pointer clicks that have missed any target            | `(event) => {}`                                          |

The canvas props should be used as a _constructor_. To update the canvas props, set the state like this:

```jsx
const set = useThree((state) => state.set)
set({ frameloop: 'demand' })
```

### Defaults that the canvas component sets up

Canvas will create a translucent THREE.WebGLRenderer with the following properties:

- antialias=true
- alpha=true
- powerPreference="high-performance"
- setClearAlpha(0)
- A THREE.Perspective camera
- A THREE.Orthographic cam if `orthographic` is true
- A THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap if `shadows` is true
- A THREE.Scene (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a THREE.Raycaster
- A [resize observer](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-measure)

<Hint>
  The colorspace will be set to sRGB (unless "linear" is true), all colors and textures will be
  auto-converted. Consult https://www.donmccurdy.com/2020/06/17/color-management-in-threejs for more
  information about this. Unless "flat" is true it will set up THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping for
  slightly more contrast.
