The `Canvas` object is where you start to define your React Three Fiber Scene.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { Canvas } from '@react-three/fiber'

const App = () => (
  <Canvas>
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <mesh>
      <sphereBufferGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial color="hotpink" />
    </mesh>
  </Canvas>
)
```

The props available for the canvas are:

| Prop            | Description                                                                                                                                       | Default                                                  |

The canvas props should be used as a _constructor_. To update the canvas props, set the state like this:

```jsx
const set = useThree((state) => state.set)
set({ frameloop: 'demand' })
```

### Defaults that the canvas component sets up

Canvas will create a translucent `THREE.WebGLRenderer` with the following properties:

- antialias=true
- alpha=true
- powerPreference="high-performance"
- setClearAlpha(0)
- A `THREE.Perspective` camera
- A `THREE.Orthographic` cam if `orthographic` is true
- A `THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap` if `shadows` is true
- A `THREE.Scene` (into which all the JSX is rendered) and a `THREE.Raycaster`
- A [resize observer](https://github.com/react-spring/react-use-measure)

<Hint>
  The colorspace will be set to sRGB (unless "linear" is true), all colors and textures will be
  auto-converted. Consult [donmccurdy.com: Color Management in
  three.js](https://www.donmccurdy.com/2020/06/17/color-management-in-threejs) for more information
  about this. Unless "flat" is true it will set up `THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping` for slightly more
  contrast.
