This tutorial will assume some React and TypeScript knowledge, and will be based on [this starter codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/brnsm), so you can fork it and follow along.

## Typing refs

React's `useRef` won't automatically infer types despite pointing it to a typed element.

You can type the ref yourself by passing an element's type through via generics:

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { Mesh } from 'three'

function Box(props) {
  const ref = useRef<Mesh>(null!)

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(Boolean(ref.current))
  }, [])

  return (
    <mesh {...props} ref={props}>
      <boxGeometry />
      <meshBasicMaterial />
    </mesh>
  )
}
```

The exclamation mark is a non-null assertion which will let TS know that `ref.current` is defined when we access it in effects.

## Typing shorthand props

react-three-fiber accepts short-hand props like scalars, strings, and arrays so you can declatively set properties without side-effects.

Here are the different variations of props:

```tsx
import { Euler, Vector3, Color } from 'three'

rotation: Euler || [x, y, z]
position: Vector3 || [x, y, z] || scalar
color: Color || 'hotpink' || 0xffffff
```

Each property has extended types which you can pull from to type these properties.

```tsx
import { Euler, Vector3, Color } from '@react-three/fiber'
// or
// import { ReactThreeFiber } from '@react-three/fiber'
// ReactThreeFiber.Euler, ReactThreeFiber.Vector3, etc.

rotation: Euler
position: Vector3
color: Color
```

This is particularly useful if you are typing properties outside of components, such as a store or a hook.

## Extend usage

react-three-fiber can also accept third-party elements and extend them into its internal catalogue.

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { GridHelper } from 'three'
import { extend } from '@react-three/fiber'

// Create our custom element
class CustomElement extends GridHelper {}

// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it
extend({ CustomElement })
```

The catalogue teaches the underlying reconciler about how to create fibers for these elements and treat them within the scene.

You can then declatively create custom elements with primitives, but TypeScript won't know about them nor their props.

```html
// error: 'customElement' does not exist on type 'JSX.IntrinsicElements'

<customElement />
```

### Node Helpers

react-three-fiber exports helpers which you can use to define different types of nodes. These nodes will define an element which we'll attach to the global JSX namespace.

```tsx
Node
Object3DNode
BufferGeometryNode
MaterialNode
LightNode
```

### Extending JSX.IntrinsicElements

Since our custom element is an object, we'll use `Object3DNode` to define it.

```tsx
import { useRef, useEffect } from 'react'
import { GridHelper } from 'three'
import { extend, Object3DNode } from '@react-three/fiber'

// Create our custom element
class CustomElement extends GridHelper {}

// Extend so the reconciler will learn about it
extend({ CustomElement })

// Add types to JSX.Intrinsic elements so primitives pick up on it
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      customElement: Object3DNode<CustomElement, typeof CustomElement>
    }
  }
}

// react-three-fiber will create your custom component and TypeScript will understand it
;<customComponent />
```
